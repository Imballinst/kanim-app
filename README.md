## kanim-app [Status: WIP Prototype]

Sometimes, it is really annoying to refresh http://antrian.imigrasi.go.id/ over time in order to do online registration. I don't want to repeat that kind of time-wasting action, so instead, I reverse-engineered their website and intended to build a brand new application.

### What's Special About This

Interval registration checking. If you want to register at certain date and time, it will do it for you with your chosen interval. Let's say you want to register at January 5, 2017 in the morning, with 1 minute interval. Every 1 minute, the application will check the availability. If yes, it will send your registration data, if not, it will repeat next minute.
